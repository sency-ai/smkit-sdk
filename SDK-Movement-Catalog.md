# Movements Catalog

This catalog lists **every movement currently defined in the SDK** and the string you should pass to the API to enable it. It’s organized by category so developers and customer stakeholders can quickly find what’s supported and how to use it efficiently.

## How to read this
- **Movement** — human-friendly name.
- **SDK String** — the exact identifier to use when configuring the SDK.
- **Description** — short guidance on form and intent (added where it wasn’t present in the CSV).
- **Body Zone** — primary regions involved.
- **Preferred View** — recommended camera orientation for best tracking (Front/Side).
- **Video** — ✓ = instruction video available, ⏳ = coming soon.

> **Side notation.** Variants labeled *(left/right)* or with `Left/Right` in the SDK string are tracked per side. When relevant, create two sets (one per side) to capture balanced metrics.

## General capture recommendations
- Keep the **full body in frame**; camera at ~hip to chest height, lens facing the user.
- Stand **2–3 m** from the camera for standing movements; **1.5–2 m** for floor work.
- Prefer **Front** view for bilateral/symmetry checks and **Side** view for hinge, push-up, and plank mechanics.
- Use even lighting; avoid strong backlight.
