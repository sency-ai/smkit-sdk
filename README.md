### UI Kit

**Who is this for?** Ideal for stakeholders who need a quick, low-code solution.

The UI Kit offers a rapid deployment model where the entire user interface and experience are pre-designed by us. This kit allows you to leverage our complete UI with minimal coding effort, enabling you to focus on swift implementation.

### Base Kit

**Who is this for?** Best suited for developers looking to build and customize their own experiences.

The Base Kit is designed for those who prefer a hands-on approach. It does not include any predefined UI, providing a clean slate for thorough customization and personalization. This option requires more coding but offers greater flexibility and control over the integration process.
