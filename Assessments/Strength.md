# Sency's AI Strength Assessment

Welcome to a new era of fitness with Sency's AI Strength Assessment, a state-of-the-art feature designed to revolutionize your fitness experience. In less than 4 minutes, our three-step assessment will not only enhance the onboarding of your members but also track and showcase their progress over time. Dive into a detailed understanding of your members' muscles' core and endurance strength.

## How It Works, and what is muscle strength?
Muscle strength is defined as the maximum force a muscle can produce in a single effort, while endurance strength is the ability of a muscle to sustain repeated contractions or maintain a contraction over time. Developing both types of strength is essential for maintaining overall physical health and functional capacity.

Our strength assessment consists of the following three key exercises, each designed to test different aspects of muscle endurance or core strength:


1. **60 Seconds Maximum Pushups Test**
   - **Purpose**: Measures upper body strength and endurance.
   - **Benefits**: Assesses muscular stamina and upper body conditioning.

2. **60 Seconds Maximum Bodyweight Squats Test**
   - **Purpose**: Assesses lower body strength and endurance.
   - **Benefits**: Determines leg power, endurance capabilities, and range of motion.

3. **60 Seconds Perfect Plank Test (Static)**
   - **Purpose**: Gauges core strength and stability.
   - **Benefits**: Vital for evaluating core endurance and preventing injuries.
