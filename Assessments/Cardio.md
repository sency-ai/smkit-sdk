# Sency's AI Cardio Assessment

Welcome to the cutting edge of cardiovascular fitness assessment with Sency's AI Cardio Assessment. This innovative feature is designed to evaluate cardiovascular health and fitness through a dynamic and engaging approach. Utilizing real-time analytics, this assessment provides a detailed snapshot of an individual's aerobic capacity and endurance, leveraging state-of-the-art technology to monitor and enhance cardiovascular training.

## How It Works, Understanding Cardiovascular Fitness
Cardiovascular fitness is a critical component of physical health, defined by the ability of the heart and lungs to supply oxygen-rich blood to the working muscles during sustained physical activity. It is measured through parameters like heart rate response and maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), which reflect the efficiency and capacity of an individual's cardiovascular system.

## The Assessment Protocol
Our Cardio Assessment incorporates high-intensity plyometric exercises to simulate the demands of real-world activities. These exercises are designed to maximize cardiovascular response in a short period, providing a comprehensive measure of an individual's cardiovascular efficiency and endurance.

## Exercises Included
Jumping Jacks and Ski Jumps: These plyometric exercises are chosen for their ability to rapidly increase heart rate and challenge the body's aerobic capacity. 
The assessment includes a series of increasing repetitions over a three-minute window, testing the body's response to escalating physical demands.
